# Cosmos Full Stack Journey

## Legend
**This tutorial describes the end to end journey and resulting state transitions of user interacting with the application.**


##### Interactions are documented at three levels of the stack:

**‚öõÔ∏è APP** - The instance of the application that the user interacts with

**üöÄ SDK** - The instance of the application that the Consensus application is communicating with.

**‚òÑÔ∏è COMET** - The validator (single instance) that the State Machine is communicating with.

For the purpose of this demonstration, the application used will be a minimal SDK application [Neutrino](https://github.com/fatal-fruit/neutrino)

See the following SDK and Comet forks to 

<hr>

## Setup

1. Clone the application respository
```shell
git clone https://github.com/fatal-fruit/neutrino.git && cd neutrino
```

2. Start the localnet
```shell
make start-localnet
```

## User Journey

### Bank Send

Once the localnet is running, make the following transaction against the application in another session:
```shell
./build/neutrinod tx bank send  $(./build/neutrinod  keys show alice -a --home ~/.neutrinod-liveness --keyring-backend test)  $(./build/neutrinod  keys show bob -a --home ~/.neutrinod-liveness --keyring-backend test) 1000uneutrino --home ~/.neutrinod-liveness --keyring-backend test
```

After the transaction has been included in the block, stop the node and export state to verify the relevant transitions in the bank module.
There should be a `1000uneutrino` change in the bank balances of `Alice` and `Bob`.
```shell
./build/neutrinod  export --home ~/.neutrinod-liveness 
```
